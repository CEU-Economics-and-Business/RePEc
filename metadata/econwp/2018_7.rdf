Title: International Business Cycle and Financial Intermediation 


Abstract: The paper extends a standard two-country international real business cycle model to include financial intermediation by banks of loans and government bonds. The paper contributes an explanation for both the US relative to the Euro-area, and the US relative to China, of cross-country correlations of loan rates, deposit rates, and the loan premia. It shows a type of financial retrenchment for the US relative to both Europe and China following a negative bank productivity shock, such as during the 2008 crisis. After 2008, results suggest the Euro-area has been more financially integrated with the US, and China less financially integrated.
