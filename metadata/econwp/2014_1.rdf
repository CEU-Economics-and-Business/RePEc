Title: The Estimation of Multi-dimensional Fixed Effects Panel Data Models
Abstract: The paper introduces for the most frequently used three-dimensional fixed effects panel data models the appropriate Within estimators. It analyzes the behaviour of these estimators in the case of no-self-flow data, unbalanced data and dynamic autoregressive models. Then the main results are generalized for higher dimensional panel data sets as well.
